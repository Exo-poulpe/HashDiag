# 🔐 HashDiag - Multi-threaded Hash Cracker in C

**HashDiag** is a fast, minimalistic, and fully C-based tool for cracking hash values (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, etc.) using a wordlist. It leverages **OpenMP** for multi-threading and is part of a personal cybersecurity toolbox.

(The code was not generated by IA it was for my pleasure and i used IA for README and some description/OpemMP manipulation so i can be smelly 😇 )

⚠️ Some issue with big files (At the end of file some word not in the file appear)

## 🚀 Compilation

> ⚠️ Requires a precompiled [LibTomCrypt](https://github.com/libtom/libtomcrypt) static library in `include/libtomcrypt/`.


Compile using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc -fopenmp -o hashcrack src/*.c include/libtomcrypt/libtomcrypt.a -Iinclude/libtomcrypt/src/headers
```

or use the *Makefile* (compile only my tool)

## 🔢 Supported Hash Algorithms

| ID | Algorithm |
|----|-----------|
| 0  | MD5       | 
| 1  | MD2       |
| 2  | MD4       |
| 3  | SHA1      |
| 4  | SHA256    |
| 5  | SHA512    |

---

## 📦 Usage

```bash
./HashDiag -t <hash> -w <wordlist> -a <algo_id> -c <threads> -v
```

### 🧪 Example

```bash
./HashDiag -t 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99 -w rockyou.txt -a 0 -c 4 -v
```

## 🧾 Example Output (verbose mode)

```bash
Thread[2] tried: "123456" -> e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e
Thread[3] tried: "password" -> 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
[+] Password found: "password"
```

## ⚠️ Notes

- Large wordlist? HashCrack uses a thread-safe buffered reading model using `#pragma omp critical`.
- All algorithms are powered by the static version of [LibTomCrypt](https://github.com/libtom/libtomcrypt).
- This tool is intended **only for ethical and educational purposes.**
